    <p>Players will enter their names. There must be a minimum of 2 players and there is a maximum of 4 players.</p>
    <p>Once all players have been added to the game, you can start the game!</p>
    <p>The first player will choose truth or dare by clicking on one of the buttons. The player can then complete their truth or dare, earning points, or forfeit their truth or dare and earn no points.</p> 
    <p id="punishments">Punishments for forfeiting are up to the group playing! </p>
    <p>The game will continue until you get tired of playing it, as there are plenty of truth or dare questions to keep you entertained for hours!</p>
